# Onion Monero Blockchain Explorer

Curently available Monero blockchain explorer websites have several limitations which are of special importance to privacy-oriented users:

 - they use JavaScript,
 - have images which might be used for [cookieless tracking](http://lucb1e.com/rp/cookielesscookies/),
 - track users activates through google analytics,
 - are closed sourced,
 - are not available as hidden services,
 - provide only basic search capabilities,
 - can't identify users outputs based on provided Monero address and viewkey.


In this example, these limitations are addressed by development of
an Onion Monero Blockchain Explorer. The example not only shows how to use Monero C++ libraries, but also demonstrates how to use:

 - [crow](https://github.com/ipkn/crow) - C++ micro web framework
 - [lmdb++](https://github.com/bendiken/lmdbxx) - C++ wrapper for the LMDB
 - [mstch](https://github.com/no1msd/mstch) - C++ {{mustache}} templates
 - [rapidjson](https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson) - C++ JSON parser/generator

## Prerequisite

Everything here was done and tested using Monero 0.9.4 on Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64.

Instruction for Monero 0.9 compilation and Monero headers and libraries setup are
as shown here:
 - [Compile Monero 0.9 on Ubuntu 16.04 x64](https://github.com/moneroexamples/compile-monero-09-on-ubuntu-16-04)
 - [lmdbcpp-monero](https://github.com/moneroexamples/lmdbcpp-monero.git)

## C++ code

```c++
int main(int ac, const char* av[]) {

    // get command line options
    xmreg::CmdLineOptions opts {ac, av};

    auto help_opt = opts.get_option<bool>("help");

    // if help was chosen, display help text and finish
    if (*help_opt)
    {
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

    auto port_opt           = opts.get_option<string>("port");
    auto bc_path_opt        = opts.get_option<string>("bc-path");
    auto custom_db_path_opt = opts.get_option<string>("custom-db-path");
    auto deamon_url_opt     = opts.get_option<string>("deamon-url");

    //cast port number in string to uint16
    uint16_t app_port = boost::lexical_cast<uint16_t>(*port_opt);

    // get blockchain path
    path blockchain_path;

    if (!xmreg::get_blockchain_path(bc_path_opt, blockchain_path))
    {
        cerr << "Error getting blockchain path." << endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

     // enable basic monero log output
    xmreg::enable_monero_log();

    // create instance of our MicroCore
    // and make pointer to the Blockchain
    xmreg::MicroCore mcore;
    cryptonote::Blockchain* core_storage;

    // initialize mcore and core_storage
    if (!xmreg::init_blockchain(blockchain_path.string(),
                               mcore, core_storage))
    {
        cerr << "Error accessing blockchain." << endl;
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // create instance of page class which
    // contains logic for the website
    xmreg::page xmrblocks(&mcore, core_storage, *deamon_url_opt);

    // crow instance
    crow::SimpleApp app;

        return xmrblocks.show_my_outputs(tx_hash, xmr_address, viewkey);

    CROW_ROUTE(app, "/search").methods("GET"_method)
    ([&](const crow::request& req) {
        return xmrblocks.search(string(req.url_params.get("value")));

    // run the crow http server
    app.port(app_port).multithreaded().run();

## Compile and run the explorer

##### Monero headers and libraries setup

The Onion Explorer uses Monero C++ libraries and headers. Also some functionality
 in the Explorer for mempool is achieved through [patching](https://github.com/moneroexamples/compile-monero-09-on-ubuntu-16-04/blob/master/res/tx_blob_to_tx_info.patch)
 the Monero deamon.
 Instructions how to download Monero source files, apply a patch, compile  Monero,
 setup header and library files are presented here:

- https://github.com/moneroexamples/compile-monero-09-on-ubuntu-16-04 (Ubuntu 16.04)
- https://github.com/moneroexamples/compile-monero-09-on-arch-linux (Arch Linux)


##### Custom lmdb database (optional)

Most unique search abilities of the Onion Explorer are achieved through using
a [custom lmdb database](https://github.com/moneroexamples/lmdbcpp-monero.git) constructed based on the Monero blockchain.
The reason for the custom database is that Monero's own lmdb database has limited
search abilities. For example, its not possible to search for a tx having a
 given key image, except by performing an exhaustive search on the blockchain which is very time consuming.

Instruction how to compile the `lmdbcpp-monero` are provided here:

 - https://github.com/moneroexamples/lmdbcpp-monero.git

The custom database is rather big, 12GB now, and it must be running alongside Monero deamon
 so that it keeps updating itself with new information from new blocks as they are added
  to the blockchain.

For these reasons, its use is optional. However, without it, some searches wont be possible,
e.g., searching for key images, output and tx public keys, encrypted payments id.

##### Compile and run the explorer
Once the Monero is compiled and setup, the explorer can be downloaded and compiled
as follows:

```bash
# download the source code
git clone https://github.com/moneroexamples/onion-monero-blockchain-explorer.git

# enter the downloaded sourced code folder
cd onion-monero-blockchain-explorer

# create the makefile
cmake .

# compile
make
```

When compilation finishes executable `xmrblocks` should be created.

To run it:
```
./xmrblocks
```

Example output:

```bash
[mwo@arch onion-monero-blockchain-explorer]$ ./xmrblocks
2016-May-28 10:04:49.160280 Blockchain initialized. last block: 1056761, d0.h0.m12.s47 time ago, current difficulty: 1517857750
(2016-05-28 02:04:49) [INFO    ] Crow/0.1 server is running, local port 8081
```
